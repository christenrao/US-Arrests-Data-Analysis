### US Arrests Data Visualization and Clustering Project

#### Project Name
**US Arrests Data Analysis with PCA and Clustering**

#### Description
This project focuses on analyzing the 'US Arrests' dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques (Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means). The dataset contains arrest statistics per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape across 50 US states, along with the percentage of the population living in urban areas.

The primary objective is to:
- Perform PCA to identify key components explaining variance in the data.
- Apply Hierarchical and K-Means Clustering to classify US states based on arrest statistics and urbanization patterns, revealing meaningful trends and insights.
